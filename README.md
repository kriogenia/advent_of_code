# Advent of Code

This repository contains all my partial attempts to the Advent of Code divided
by years. Each year I attempt the challenge with a different language so I can
use this event as an excuse to reinforce my knowledge with some languages or
learn new ones.

| [2021](./2021) | [2022](./2022) | [2024](./2024) |

| **Python** | **Rust** | **Zig** |

Inside the folder of each year you can find a different README.md with the
information about the structure used, how it can be run, acknowledgments and
sometimes a few afterthoughts of my journey throughout the challenges.
