# Advent of Code

This repository contains all my partial attempts to the Advent of Code divided
by years. Each year I attempt the challenge with a different language so I can
use this event as an excuse to reinforce my knowledge with some languages or
learn new ones.

* [2021](./2021/). <i class="devicon-python-plain colored"></i> **Python**
* [2022](./2022/). <i class="devicon-rust-original colored"></i> **Rust**

Inside the folder of each year you can find a different README.md with the
information about the structure used, how it can be run, acknowledgments and
sometimes a few afterthoughts of my journey throughout the challenges.
