What is Advent of Code? From the author, **Eric Wastl**:

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be
> solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university
> coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
>
> You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some
> problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution
> that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

This repository contains all my partial attempts to the Advent of Code divided
by years. Each year I attempt the challenge with a different language so I can
use this event as an excuse to reinforce my knowledge with some languages or
learn new ones.

Inside the folder of each year you can find a different README.md with the
information about the structure used, how it can be run, acknowledgments and
sometimes a few afterthoughts of my journey throughout the challenges.
