Personal solutions to the [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) using Python 3.10. Each day is done in its
own file `aoc_2021/day_<day>.py` and can be run via `uv run python -m aoc_2021.day_<day>` (in case that you have `uv`, you
are free to use your favourite flavour), once its input file is placed as `input/day_<day>.txt`.

All the examples are also completed as tests and can be checked with:

```sh
uv pip install -e .
uv run pytest
```

No dependency is ever used so a simple Python 3.10 or later in the environment is enough to try all the solutions.

Also, there's a justfile to easily do some of these recipes:

```sh
just run 01 # to run day_01
just test   # to run all tests
just time   # to run the time suite
```

## Afterthoughts

- This didn't exist at first but I will take the chance to create them while migrating the whole thing.
- I'm not a fan of `__getattribute__` but this is inputs like the one in **Day 02** are the kind of places where it is handy.
- **Day 04**, the day that will always be known as they I used a for-else.
- Taking the floor and ceil averages in **Day 07** to work with both the example and input seems like a hack, but getting the solution is what matters.
- So I came back three years later to finish the second part of the **Day 08** and it was quite the different thing.
- First use of `@functools.cache` in **Day 10**, I'm a pro.
