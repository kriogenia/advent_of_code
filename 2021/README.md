# Advent of Code 2021

Personal solutions to the [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) using Python 3.10.
Each day is divided into its own folder and can contain one file
for the solution with the number of the day (`<day>.py`) or two,
one for each problem of the day (`<day>a.py` and `<day>b.py`).
In some cases a `util.py` is also located in the folder to share
common code between both problems.

In order to run these problems you need to locate the problem file
in the day folder with the name `input.txt` and just run the Python
script. For example:

```shell
python 01/01a.py
```

No dependency is ever used so a simple Python 3.10 or later in the
environment is enough to try all the solutions.
