# Advent of Code 2021

Personal solutions to the [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) using Python 3.10. Each day is done in its
own fail `aoc_2021/day_<day>.py` an can be run via `uv run python -m aoc_2021.day_<day>` (in case that you have `uv`, you
are free to use your favourite flavour), once its input file is placed as `input/day_<day>.txt`.

All the examples are also completed as tests and can be checked with:

```
uv pip install -e .
uv run pytest
```

No dependency is ever used so a simple Python 3.10 or later in the environment is enough to try all the solutions.
