# Templating

In order to ease the generation of all the READMEs of this repository a very basic templating was put in place to run with pre-commit. That way every completion can be easily added to the template of the year and automatically used to generate a beautiful completion table and the overall track in the root README. This is done with the [./generate_readmes.py] script.
