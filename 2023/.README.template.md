Personal solutions to the [2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) using Typescript with Deno as the runtime.
Each day is implemented into its own file `src/day_{day}.ts`, exporting the functions to parse the input and to solve them. These are imported in runtime in the `main.ts` file. A certain day can be invoked with the `day` task:

```sh
deno task day 01
```

The test files are located in `test` and executed via `deno test -R`. The input files must be placed in `input`.

Only `std` dependencies were used. Every solution can be solved with a simple `deno` installation.
