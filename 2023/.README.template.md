Personal solutions to the [2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) using Typescript with Deno as the runtime.
Each day is implemented into its own file `src/day_{day}.ts`, exporting the functions to parse the input and to solve them. These are imported in runtime in the `main.ts` file. A certain day can be invoked with the `day` task:

```sh
deno task day 01
```

The test files are located in `test` and executed via `deno test -R`. The input files must be placed in `input`.

Only `std` dependencies were used. Every solution can be solved with a simple `deno` installation.

## Afterthoughts

- **Day 04**. I remembered JS/TS like really comfortable languages to write functional programming, based on things like not needing to collect and all that, but after some time working other functional languages I find the standard set of functions quite lackluster. I miss `take`, `skip`, `count`...
- **Day 05**. First real challenge where the straightforward approach was not enough. Handling ranges is quite the challenge sometimes, but also very entertaining. Oh, and every time I use a labeled loop my brain tickles.
