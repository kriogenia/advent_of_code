Personal solutions to the [2025 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025) using Gleam 1.13.
This will be my first contact with this language.

Each day is resolved in its own file inside `src` and runs
the related `input/day<day>.txt` file to resolve the problem.
It also contains a test for every example that can be checked
with `gleam test`.

In order to execute a day solution run `gleam run -m day_<day>`.
For example:

```sh
gleam run -m day_01
```

// completion=start

1:2
2:2
3:1

// completion=end

## Afterthoughts

- **Day 01**: Ok, I am loving this one. Functional language with
a Rust-like syntax instead of the something painful like Elixir's.
Sign me in.
* **Day 02**: While I like my solution, there's probably some optimizations
that can be done and solve the "slowness" a bit. Mainly regarding all
the parsing and serialization back and forth.
